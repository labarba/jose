# Reviewer Guidelines

#### Thank you for agreeing to review for JOSE! Follow this guide to help you complete your review, and feel free to ask editors for more help using any medium (email, Twitter, comments on review issues, etc.)

## JOSE review principles

JOSE accepts two types of submissions, and your role as reviewer will be different depending on the type. For software submissions, you will download, build, test and assess the software quality. For learning modules, you will download and read, test code components, and assess content and pedagogy.

For both types of submissions, your goal as reviewer is to help authors improve the quality of the submission to the standard for acceptance into JOSE. Categorical rejections are expected only in cases of out-of-scope or otherwise ineligible submissions.
If authors decide they cannot meet your requests for improvements, however, they can withdraw their submission.

JOSE provides a checklist for review. You will check off each item, as you proceed with the review, adding comments and suggestions in the Review issue thread. You may also post specific issues on the main repository of the submitted software or module. Be sure to post links between the JOSE Review issue and the submission repository's issue tracker, as needed.

## JOSE aim and scope

We're witnessing a swelling of communities that develop and share tools and practices in computationally enabled teaching and learning. 
The founding editors of JOSE have been participating in these communities, and recognized a need for a publication to house these scholarly products in a citable form. 

Several journals already exist that publish academic papers reporting on _education research_ â€”the systematic collection and analysis of data on teaching methods and student learning, and related qualitative studies. 
JOSE has a different scope. 
We're focused on the rich and growing work applying computational methods to enhance teaching and learning. 
For example, a whole new genre of open educational resources (OER) has sprouted out of creating and sharing Jupyter notebooks, in a variety of subjects benefitting from a computational treatment. 
At the same time, members of open-source communities are creating software tools to automate processes (like grading), facilitate access to computing for learning (via cloud systems), or otherwise enhance teaching and learning with computing. 
These are valuable contributions, independently of their possible use in education research, and their creators merit publication and citaion credit for them. 

JOSE also aims to disseminate the best practices in creating these scholarly objects, and increase quality via peer review. 
We want to be a formal, yet open and collegial vehicle for sharing accumulated knowledge in using computing to teach and learn. 


## The JOSE paper

Authors will submit a paper to accompany their software or learning module, consisting of the following minimum items:

* Title, and author list with affiliations
* Description of the software or learning module
* Statement of need
* Key references, including the submission archive

Detailed documentation should be present in the repository of the submitted software or module, is reviewed there, and does not need to be included in the paper.

## Submission Requirements

### License

The submission should be open, under the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org). Any text content or graphical objects should be under a Creative Commons license (ideally CC-BY) and code components should be under an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
License information must be clearly visible in the submission's online repository, which must include a plain-text LICENSE file.

### Statement of need

A key component of the JOSE paper is a statement by the authors, explaining the contribution made by the submitted artifacts to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be used by others.
The criterion is less one of novelty, than _need_: submissions targeting subjects or applications already addressed by other resources _are eligible_, if the authors make a case for why they might be adopted by learners or other instructors.

### Community guidelines

The online repository of the software or learning module needs to contain guidelines for potential contributors who may want to: submit changes, make improvements or report issues.

### Specific requirements for software submissions

**Documentation:** The software repository should contain enough documentation to understand the functionality of the software, to guide through the build process (including a list of dependencies), and to complete examples of use. 

**Tests:** Software quality depends on testing. Ideally, the software should include an automated test suite, but it's also acceptable to include documented manual steps to test the functionality of the software. 

**Examples:** Potential users of new software rely on well-documented examples to get started. Reviewers will look for examples of use that illustrate beginner and advanced functionality
