# Reviewer Guidelines

#### Thank you for agreeing to review for JOSE! Follow this guide to help you complete your review, and feel free to ask editors for more help using any medium (email, Twitter, comments on review issues, etc.)

## JOSE review principles

JOSE accepts two types of submissions, and your role as reviewer will be different depending on the type. For software submissions, you will download, build, test and assess the software quality. For learning modules, you will download and read, test code components, and assess content and pedagogy.

For both types of submissions, your goal as reviewer is to help authors improve the quality of the submission to the standard for acceptance into JOSE. Categorical rejections are expected only in cases of out-of-scope or otherwise ineligible submissions.
If authors decide they cannot meet your requests for improvements, however, they can withdraw their submission.

JOSE provides a checklist for review. You will check off each item, as you proceed with the review, adding comments and suggestions in the Review issue thread. You may also post specific issues on the main repository of the submitted software or module. Be sure to post links between the JOSE Review issue and the submission repository's issue tracker, as needed.

## The JOSE paper

Authors will submit a paper to accompany their software or learning module, consisting of the following minimum items:

* Title, and author list with affiliations
* Description of the software or learning module
* Statement of need
* Key references, including the submission archive

Detailed documentation should be present in the repository of the submitted software or module, is reviewed there, and should not be included in the paper.

## Requirements

### License

The submission should be open, under the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org). Any text content or graphical objects should be under a Creative Commons license (ideally CC-BY) and code components should be under an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
License information must be clearly visible in the submission's online repository, which must include a plain-text LICENSE file.

### Statement of Need

A key component of the JOSE paper is a statement by the authors, explaining the contribution made by the submitted artifacts to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be used by others.
The criterion is less one of novelty, than _need_: submissions targeting subjects or applications already addressed by other resources _are eligible_, if the authors make a case for why they might be adopted by learners or other instructors.
