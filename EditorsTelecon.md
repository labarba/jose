# JOSE Editors Telecon

## Launch call: 14-May-2018

**Agenda**

1. Moving from soft launch to LAUNCH!!
2. What is our idea of a “learning module” (where do we place the “bar”?)
3. What about edu software? What’s the scale? (JOSS has a “minor utility” bar)
4. Impressions on our first two submissions
5. How to advertise the LAUNCH!!
6. Inviting new board member: Carol Willing (feel free to respond to this by email)

**Present**:

* Lorena Barba
* Robert Talbert
* Tracy Teal
* Kyle Niemeyer
* Chuck Severance

**Notes**

* The JOSE paper should: 
  * demonstrate that the submission meets the requirements for eligibility; in particular, since modules should be complete and immediately usable for adoption or self-learning, the paper should explain how an instructor might adapt the module, or how an dindependent learner might use it.
  * make the case for the submission's contribution —> under a "Statement of Need" heading
  * how has it been used? what's the evidence that it works?
  * give enough information for readers to decide if they would be interested in adopting/using
* Submission "size": 
  * a SciPy or PyCon tutorial could be a "minimum size" module—but should contain narrative (can be used outside tutorial setting)
  * author has put substantial effort in createing the module and has expertise to teach it
* The review should assess: can someone else teach with it?

[ ] L Barba will make updates to the Author Guide and Review Checklist to reflect this discussion.
